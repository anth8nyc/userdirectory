# Employee Directory READme


## Description
The employee directory allows for a list of employees to easily be filtered through with search criteria. Users should be able to view the entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees in this manner and it is particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
